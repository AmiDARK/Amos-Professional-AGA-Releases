# About AMOS Professional X for AGA support.
> The project that did initially takes the name "Amos Professional X" was stopped. With the official release of Amos Professional under MIT Licence, I have reopened this project.
For the moment Source code is private but it will be released under the original MIT Licence when everything will be finished.

> I have much respect about the huge amount of work François did to create AMOS and AMOS Professional but, for the moment, and in respect to the MIT Licence terms capabilities (source : https://github.com/Francaoz/AMOS-Professional-Official/blob/master/LICENSE seen in the GitHub box about MIT Licence "A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code." ) and not restricted by licence information added by François, I consider that improving AMOS Professional with AGA support is a larger work as it require me to makes many changes in many components of the AMOS Professional engine (copper list, sprites, bob, iff/ilbm, load/save datas, internal structures, etc.).<br>
With these, I prefer not release the source code for the moment.<br>
Source code will probably be released for "educational purposes" when the project will be finished (and more especially because it was initially planed with the AMOS Factory team to include this major update inside their major updates, and I want to respect this engagment with the AMOS Factory team)

> The current repository now contain the latest version that was done under Amos Professional X, originally forked from marc365 repository, from where François Lionet also based his official release.<br>

>It is a restart of the whole project concerning AGA support, and as it is a "free time" development (not commercial), I can promise nothing about future releases/updates dates.

>I hope that everything will be ok with François Lionet now as I don't want to steal his work. Just protect mine. I hope he can understand this.
